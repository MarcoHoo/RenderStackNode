### How it works

![1.0](img/1.0.png)
1. Use **Settings Node** to overwirte your render settings,such as:

	+ **Camera Node** have the ability to change the camera
	+ **File path Node** give an format name of the render files
	+ **Eevee Setting Node** means that in this task you will render with the eevee engine
	+ **Frame Range Node** control the frame you want to render

2. Use **Task Node** to merge your changes into one render task (animation or still image)

3. Use **Viewer Node** to check your overwriten scene

4. Use **Render List Node** to render all the task that you need

> *Once you plug a node settings to overide something into the a task,the next task will inherit it if there is not a same type Node plug input. So you may start a new render list to keep your node tree cleaner*



**But also, we can use node like this**

![1.1](img/1.1.png)
> In 1.1.0 version, there is a **task info** node for direct input the changes with text file:
> when it links to a **task** which is linking to a **viewer**,the scene will load these changes below

```json
{
    "label": "task1",
    "camera": "Camera",
    "engine": "BLENDER_EEVEE",
    "samples": 64,
    "use_blend_file_path": true,
    "path_format": "$blend_render/$label$camera",
    "path": "",
    "res_x": 1920,
    "res_y": 1080,
    "res_scale": 100
