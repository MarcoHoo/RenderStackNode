# Node-based RenderStack [Blender Addon]

Design Target: Provide users with node-based, flexible rendering output methods

Preliminary idea (finish getting info from nodes)

**Info Node Name**

> use it to get value to overwrite settings

```json
{
  "Task": [
    "Camera",
    "Camera Settings",
    "Cycles Settings",
    "Output Settings"
  ],
  "Task.001": [
    "Camera.001",
    "Camera Settings.001",
    "Eevee Settings",
    "Output Settings"
  ]
}
```
